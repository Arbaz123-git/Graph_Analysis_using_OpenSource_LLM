# Graph_Analysis_using_OpenSource_LLM

Objective:

Developing a Streamlit application with input fields for the csv files and performing a graph analysis.

Writing a Python script that:

1. Provides input fields for uploading CSV files and generates pre-defined prompts for possible plots.

2. Uses a pre-trained Generative AI model(Gemma) to create prompts based on the data for various types of graph distributions. 

3. Produces graphs or plots based on the prompts selected from the generated output. 

Requirements: 

One can use any pr-trained model from libraries such as Hugging Face's Transformers.
